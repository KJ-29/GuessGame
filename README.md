# GuessGame

A fun and interactive Python game where the **computer tries to guess the number you're thinking of**, using your feedback.

## How it Works

- You think of a number between 1 and `x`.
- The computer makes a guess.
- You respond with:
  -  H → too high
  -  L → too low
  -  C → correct
- It keeps narrowing the range using binary logic until it guesses right.

## Technologies Used (Tech Stack)

- Python 3
- `random` module
